> **_Really fast Server Side pages for PocketBase_**

PocketPages is a lightweight EJS and router engine that runs as a PocketBase JS hook. It's super fast and can render pages <40ms.

Write your web apps like old-school PHP:

```ejs
// pb_hooks/pages/index.ejs
<%= `Hello, world!` %>
```

## Why did I make this?

- Because when I have a new app idea, I want to make contact with the real world as soon as possible
- Because I want to start simply and grow as needed, in any direction I decide
- Because I want a unified SEO-friendly platform without needing to worry about SSR/SSG/SPA
- Because I miss the good parts of PHP
- Because I think pure client-side reactive frameworks like AlpineJS and HTMLx are a perfect compliment to Server Side pages.
